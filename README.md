In this project I mastered:

**Python**<br>
**Flask**<br>

**PyQt5**<br>
**PyQt Designer app**<br>


## Files
> server.py — this file runs Flask server and processes requests to the server.

> messenger.ui — was created automatically by PyQt Designer app.

> clientui.py — this file generates Messenger GUI. Was converted into .py format from messenger.ui using PyQt5. 

> launch_messenger.py — is the main file to launch messenger. This file consists of the messenger and the server interaction code. (by GUI Messenger interface).
